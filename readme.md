# Causion!

This app can work only in **local environment** (and not currently in chrome. **safari** and **firefox** are recommended.).


Hatena does not provide cross origin data source or jsonp api for new "interest" section.

Then to avoid cross-origin-policy errors, running app in local (in your machine) is needed.

I don't have enough time to implement proxy or crawling server..
